#  Theory for Verification of Tellegen's Theorem 

## Introduction
Tellegen's Theorem is a key concept in electrical circuits that shows the total power in a circuit balances to zero. This means the power supplied by sources (like batteries) equals the power used by components (like resistors). This virtual lab experiment helps you verify Tellegen's Theorem using a simple circuit with two voltage sources (\( V1 \), \( V2 \)) and three resistors (\( R1 \), \( R2 \), \( R3 \)).

## What is Tellegen's Theorem?
Tellegen's Theorem states that in any electrical circuit, the sum of power absorbed or delivered by all components is zero. Mathematically:
$$
\sum (v_k \cdot i_k) = 0
$$
v<sub>k</sub>  : Voltage across a component.
- \( i<sub>k</sub> \): Current through the component.
- Power (\( v<sub>k</sub> . i<sub>k</sub> \)): Positive for components that use power (e.g., resistors) and negative for components that supply power (e.g., voltage sources).

This theorem works because circuits follow Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), ensuring energy is conserved.

## Experiment Overview
In this virtual lab, you will:
1. Use a circuit with two voltage sources (\( V1 \), \( V2 \)), three resistors (\( R1 \), \( R2 \), \( R3 \)), and two switches (\( S1 \), \( S2 \)).
2. Test three cases by changing switch settings:
   - **Case 1**: Both \( V1 \) and \( V2 \) are active (( S1 \) and \( S2 \) on "Power").
   - **Case 2**: Only \( V1 \) is active (\( S1 \) on "Power," \( S2 \) on "Short").
   - **Case 3**: Only \( V2 \) is active (\( S1 \) on "Short," \( S2 \) on "Power").
3. Measure currents (\( I1 \), \( I2 \), \( I_{R3} \)) and voltage (\( V_ \)) using virtual meters.
4. Calculate power for each component and check if the total power is zero.

## Key Concepts
- **Power Calculation**:
  - For resistors: Power absorbed = \( -I<sup>2</sup>.R \) (negative because resistors use power).
  - For voltage sources: Power supplied = \( V.I \) (sign depends on current direction).
- **Cases**:
  - **Case 1**: Both sources are on, so currents and voltages depend on both \( V1 \) and \( V2 \).
  - **Case 2**: \( V2 \) is shorted (\( V2 = 0 \)), so only \( V1 \) affects the circuit.
  - **Case 3**: \( V1 \) is shorted (\( V1 = 0 \)), so only \( V2 \) affects the circuit.
- **Switches**:
  - "Power": Connects the voltage source to the circuit.
  - "Short": Removes the voltage source by short-circuiting it.
- **Meters**:
  - Ammeters (\( A1 \), \( A2 \)) measure currents \( I1 \) and \( I2 \).
  - Voltmeter (\( MC \)) measures voltage across a specific point.



## Expected Results
- For each case, the sum of powers (\( P1 + P2 + P3 + PV1 + PV2 \)) should be zero (or very close due to small calculation errors).
- Resistor powers (\( P1 \), \( P2 \), \( P3 \)) are negative, showing they consume power.
- Voltage source powers (\( PV1 \), \( PV2 \)) may be positive or negative based on current flow.
- The observation table will show power values for all three cases, confirming Tellegen’s Theorem.

## Key Points for Students
- Ensure resistor values are positive to avoid errors.
- Follow switch settings carefully for each case.
- The virtual lab uses animations to show meter readings, making it easy to visualize currents and voltages.
- Tellegen’s Theorem proves energy conservation, a core idea in circuits.

By completing this experiment, you will understand how power balances in a circuit and how Tellegen’s Theorem applies in practice.
